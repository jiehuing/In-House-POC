NAV - Net Asset Values
	Total value of the entity's assets minus the total value of its liabilities.

Net Asset Value (NAV) = (Assets – Debts) / (Number of Outstanding units)

Assets = Market value of mutual fund investments + Receivables + Accrued Income Debts = Liabilities + Expenses (accrued)

Formula:
NAV = (Assets - Liabilities) / Total number of outstanding shares
